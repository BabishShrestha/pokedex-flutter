# Sound Assets

This folder contains sound effect files for the Pokedex app.

## Required Sound Files:
- `click.mp3` - General UI click sound
- `select.mp3` - Pokemon selection sound
- `compare.mp3` - Comparison mode activation sound

## Note:
You can obtain free sound effects from:
- Freesound.org
- OpenGameArt.org
- Zapsplat.com

Or create simple sounds using online generators like:
- SFXR
- ChipTone
- Bfxr

For now, the app will handle missing audio files gracefully.
